The tests are held in scripts/, but tests should be run from ../src/.
support_files/ are files used by the tests, for example for regression.
subjects/ are the files used to test phc. Most are designed to test some
feature or tickle some bug, others (especially in subjects/3rdparty/) are
3rd-party applications we use to get some diversity. subjects/labels controls
what tests are run on which subjects. logs/ contains logs of failed tests.

To run tests from the src/ directory

	$ make test
or
	$ make long-test
or
	$ php tests/scripts/driver.php

The latter allows command line options, and limiting the tests with regular
expressions. Run driver.php with the '-h' flag for details.
