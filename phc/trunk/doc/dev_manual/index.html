			<h1>Developer Documentation</h1>
			
			<div class="warningbox">
				Documentation about how to use and run <span
				class="phc">phc</span>, and how to convert from PHP to XML and
				back, has been moved to the <a
				href="../user_manual/index.html">User Manual</a>.
			</div>
		
			<p> Because <span class="phc">phc</span> does not generate machine
			code, it not yet useful to end users. However, it can be used as a
			framework for writing applications that process PHP code. <span
			class="phc">phc</span> parses PHP code into an internal
			representation known as an <b>abstract syntax tree</b> or
			<b>AST</b>.  Applications can process PHP code by analysing and
			modifying this abstract representation in one of two ways: </p>  

			<ul>

			<li> <span class="phc">phc</span> supports <b>plugins</b>. Plugins
			are modules that can be loaded into <span class="phc">phc</span>,
			which get access to the AST. <span class="phc">phc</span> provides
			sophisticated support for writing operations over the AST through
			the <b>Tree Transformation API</b>. 

			<lI> Alternatively, you can export the AST to <b>XML</b>. You can
			then process the XML in any way you like, and then use <span
			class="phc">phc</span> to convert the XML back to PHP syntax.

			</ul>
			
			<p> <b>Writing Plugins</b> explains how to write plugins for
			<span class="phc">phc</span>, and provides numerous examples. You will
			find the <b>Reference Documentation</b> very useful when writing
			serious applications using <span class="phc">phc</span>.
			
			<p> Note that you can download the documentation for this and for
			older versions from the <a href="../../src/archive/">archive</a>.
			Moreover, although we have tried to document <span
			class="phc">phc</span> as well as we can, if anything is still
			unclear, please let us know by sending an email to the <a
			href="../../contact.html">mailing list</a>.  </p>

				<h3>Modifying Requirements</h3>

				some tasks. If you wish to modify parts of <span

				<h3>The Grammar</h3>
				
				<span class="phc">phc</span> represents PHP scripts internally as
				an abstract syntax tree. The structure of this tree is dictated by
				the (abstract) <a href="grammar.html">grammar</a>. The grammar
				definition is a very important part of <span
				class="phc">phc</span>.
	
				<h3>Representing PHP</h3>
	
				<span class="phc">phc</span>'s view on the world (as dictated by
				the grammar) does not completely agree with the PHP standard view.
				<a href="representingphp.html">Representing PHP</a> describes how
				the various PHP constructs get translated into the abstract syntax.
	
				<h3>Overview of the AST classes and transformation API</h3>

				This gives an <a href="generatedcode.html">overview</a> of the AST
				classes, the tree visitor API and the tree transformation API from
				a programmer's perspective.
				
				<h3><span class="phc">maketea</span> Theory</h3>

				<span class="phc">maketea</span> is a tool bundled with <span
				class="phc">phc</span> which, based on a grammar definition of a
				language, generates a C++ hierarchy for the corresponding abstract
				syntax tree, a tree transformation and visitor API, and deep
				cloning, deep equality and pattern matching on the AST. The <a
				href="maketeatheory.html">maketea theory</a> explains some of the
				theory behind <span class="phc">maketea</span>; in particular, the
				grammar formalism, the mapping from the grammar to the AST classes,
				and the derivation of the tree transformation API.

				<h3>Getting Started</h3>
	
				<a href="gettingstarted.html">Getting Started</a> introduces
				writing plugins for <span class="phc">phc</span>. It then explains
				how <span class="phc">phc</span> represents PHP scripts internally,
				and shows how to write a simple plugin that counts the number of
				classes in a PHP script.
	
				<h3>Tutorial 1: Traversing the Tree</h3>
	
				<a href="tutorial1.html">Tutorial 1</a> introduces the support that
				<span class="phc">phc</span> offers for traversing (and
				transforming) scripts. It shows how to write a program that counts
				the number of function calls in a script.
	
				<h3>Tutorial 2: Modifying Tree Nodes</h3>
	
				<a href="tutorial2.html">Tutorial 2</a> shows how you can modify
				nodes in the tree (without modifying the structure of the tree). It
				shows how to replace calls to <code>mysql_connect</code> by calls
				to <code>dbx_connect</code>.
	
				<h3>Tutorial 3: Restructuring the Tree</h3>
	
				<a href="tutorial3.html">Tutorial 3</a> shows how you can modify
				the structure of the tree. It works through an example that
				removes unnecessary string concatenations (for example, <code>$a .
				""</code> is replaced by just <code>$a</code>).	
				
				<h3>Tutorial 4: Using State</h3>
	
				<a href="tutorial4.html">Tutorial 4</a> explains an advanced
				features of pattern matching, and shows an important technique: the
				use of state in transformations (where one transformation depends
				on a previous transformation). It shows how to write a program that
				renames all functions <code>foo</code> in a script to
				<code>db_foo</code>, if there are calls to a database engine within
				<code>foo</code>.
				
				<h3>Tutorial 5: Modifying the Traversal Order</h3>
				
				<a href="tutorial5.html">Tutorial 5</a> explains how to change the
				order in which the children of a node are visited, avoid visiting
				some children, or how to execute a piece of code in between
				visiting two children.

				<h3>Tutorial 6: Returning Lists</h3>

				<a href="tutorial6.html">Tutorial 6</a> shows how to define
				transformations that replace nodes in the tree by multiple
				other nodes, and how to delete nodes from the tree. It also
				shows to call the <span class="phc">phc</span> parser and
				unparsers from plugins.
